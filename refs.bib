  abstract      = {Despite the rapid development of quantum computing these years, state-of-the-art quantum devices still contain only a very limited number of qubits. One possible way to execute more realistic algorithms in near-term quantum devices is to employ dynamic quantum circuits, in which measurements can happen during the circuit and their outcomes are used to control other parts of the circuit. This technique can help to significantly reduce the resources required to achieve a given accuracy of a quantum algorithm. However, since this type of quantum circuits are more flexible, their verification is much more challenging. In this paper, we give a formal definition of dynamic quantum circuits and then propose to characterise their functionality in terms of ensembles of linear operators. Based on this novel semantics, two dynamic quantum circuits are equivalent if they have the same functionality. We further propose and implement two decision diagram-based algorithms for checking the equivalence of dynamic quantum circuits. Experiments show that embedding classical logic into conventional quantum circuits does not incur significant time and space burden.},

  abstract      = {As state-of-the-art quantum computers are capable of running increasingly complex algorithms, the need for automated methods to design and test potential applications rises. Equivalence checking of quantum circuits is an important, yet hardly automated, task in the development of the quantum software stack. Recently, new methods have been proposed that tackle this problem from widely different perspectives. One of them is based on the ZX-calculus, a graphical rewriting system for quantum computing. However, the power and capability of this equivalence checking method has barely been explored. The aim of this work is to evaluate the ZX-calculus as a tool for equivalence checking of quantum circuits. To this end, it is demonstrated how the ZX-calculus based approach for equivalence checking can be expanded in order to verify the results of compilation flows and optimizations on quantum circuits. It is also shown that the ZX-calculus based method is not complete\$\textbackslash unicode\{x2014\}\$especially for quantum circuits with ancillary qubits. In order to properly evaluate the proposed method, we conduct a detailed case study by comparing it to two other state-of-the-art methods for equivalence checking: one based on path-sums and another based on decision diagrams. The proposed methods have been integrated into the publicly available QCEC tool (https://github.com/cda-tum/qcec) which is part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT).},

  abstract  = {Quantum information science explores the frontier of highly complex quantum states, the "entanglement frontier." This study is motivated by the observation (widely believed but unproven) that classical systems cannot simulate highly entangled quantum systems efficiently, and we hope to hasten the day when well controlled quantum systems can perform tasks surpassing what can be done in the classical world. One way to achieve such "quantum supremacy" would be to run an algorithm on a quantum computer which solves a problem with a super-polynomial speedup relative to classical computers, but there may be other ways that can be achieved sooner, such as simulating exotic quantum states of strongly correlated matter. To operate a large scale quantum computer reliably we will need to overcome the debilitating effects of decoherence, which might be done using "standard" quantum hardware protected by quantum error-correcting codes, or by exploiting the nonabelian quantum statistics of anyons realized in solid state systems, or by combining both methods. Only by challenging the entanglement frontier will we learn whether Nature provides extravagant resources far beyond what the classical world would allow.},

  abstract = {Identifying the boundary beyond which quantum machines provide a computational advantage over their classical counterparts is a crucial step in charting their usefulness. Gaussian boson sampling (GBS), in which photons are measured from a highly entangled Gaussian state, is a leading approach in pursuing quantum advantage. State-of-the-art GBS experiments that run in minutes would require 600 million years to simulate using the best preexisting classical algorithms. Here, we present faster classical GBS simulation methods, including speed and accuracy improvements to the calculation of loop hafnians. We test these on a ∼100,000-core supercomputer to emulate GBS experiments with up to 100 modes and up to 92 photons. This reduces the simulation time for state-of-the-art GBS experiments to several months, a nine–orders of magnitude improvement over previous estimates. Last, we introduce a distribution that is efficient to sample from classically and that passes a variety of GBS validation methods.

              Methods are developed and benchmarked that substantially reduce the time to simulate cutting-edge quantum optics experiments.},

  abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church–Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: ‘every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means’. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the 'universal quantum computer’ are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include ‘quantum parallelism’, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett’s. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the ‘complexity’ or ‘knowledge’ in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

  abstract = {To date, quantum computation on real, physical devices has largely been limited to simple, time-ordered sequences of unitary operations followed by a final projective measurement. As hardware platforms for quantum computing continue to mature in size and capability, it is imperative to enable quantum circuits beyond their conventional construction. Here we break into the realm of dynamic quantum circuits on a superconducting-based quantum system. Dynamic quantum circuits not only involve the evolution of the quantum state throughout the computation but also periodic measurements of qubits midcircuit and concurrent processing of the resulting classical information on timescales shorter than the execution times of the circuits. Using noisy quantum hardware, we explore one of the most fundamental quantum algorithms, quantum phase estimation, in its adaptive version, which exploits dynamic circuits, and compare the results to a nonadaptive implementation of the same algorithm. We demonstrate that the version of real-time quantum computing with dynamic circuits can yield results comparable to an approach involving classical asynchronous postprocessing, thus opening the door to a new realm of available algorithms on real quantum systems.},

  abstract  = {Quantum computing is an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, machine learning, optimization, and quantum simulation. However, a major challenge in the realization of quantum algorithms on actual machines is ensuring that the gates in a quantum circuit (i.e., corresponding operations) match the topology of a targeted architecture so that the circuit can be executed while, at the same time, the resulting costs (e.g., in terms of the number of additionally introduced gates, fidelity, etc.) are kept low. This is known as the quantum circuit mapping problem. This summary paper provides an overview of QMAP-an open-source tool that is part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) and offers efficient, automated, and accessible methods for tackling this problem. To this end, the paper first briefly reviews the problem. Afterwards, it shows how QMAP can be used to efficiently map quantum circuits to quantum computing architectures from both a user's and a developer's perspective. QMAP is publicly available as open-source at https://github.com/cda-tum/qmap.},

Equivalence checking of quantum circuits is an important, yet hardly automated, task in the development of the quantum software stack. Recently, new methods have been proposed that tackle this problem from widely different perspectives. However, there is no established baseline on which to judge current and future progress in equivalence checking of quantum circuits. In order to close this gap, we conduct a detailed case study of two of the most promising equivalence checking methodologies---one based on decision diagrams and one based on the ZX-calculus---and compare their strengths and weaknesses.},

In this way all the two-bit gates in the Fourier transform can be replaced by a smaller number of one-bit gates controlled by classical signals. This suggests that it may be worthwhile looking for other uses of semiclassical methods in quantum computing.},

  abstract = {Quantum physics was invented to account for two fundamental features of measurement results -- their discreetness and randomness. Emblematic of these features is Bohr's idea of quantum jumps between two discrete energy levels of an atom. Experimentally, quantum jumps were first observed in an atomic ion driven by a weak deterministic force while under strong continuous energy measurement. The times at which the discontinuous jump transitions occur are reputed to be fundamentally unpredictable. Can there be, despite the indeterminism of quantum physics, a possibility to know if a quantum jump is about to occur or not? Here, we answer this question affirmatively by experimentally demonstrating that the jump from the ground to an excited state of a superconducting artificial three-level atom can be tracked as it follows a predictable "flight," by monitoring the population of an auxiliary energy level coupled to the ground state. The experimental results demonstrate that the jump evolution when completed is continuous, coherent, and deterministic. Furthermore, exploiting these features and using real-time monitoring and feedback, we catch and reverse a quantum jump mid-flight, thus deterministically preventing its completion. Our results, which agree with theoretical predictions essentially without adjustable parameters, support the modern quantum trajectory theory and provide new ground for the exploration of real-time intervention techniques in the control of quantum systems, such as early detection of error syndromes.},

  abstract = {To solve classically hard problems, quantum computers need to be resilient to the influence of noise and decoherence. In such a fault-tolerant quantum computer, noise-induced errors must be detected and corrected in real-time to prevent them from propagating between components. This requirement is especially pertinent while applying quantum gates, when the interaction between components can cause errors to quickly spread throughout the system. However, the large overhead involved in most fault-tolerant architectures makes implementing these systems a daunting task, which motivates the search for hardware-efficient alternatives. Here, we present a gate enacted by a multilevel ancilla transmon on a cavity-encoded logical qubit that is fault-tolerant with respect to decoherence in both the ancilla and the encoded qubit. We maintain the purity of the encoded qubit in the presence of ancilla errors by detecting those errors in real-time, and applying the appropriate corrections. We show a reduction of the logical gate error by a factor of two in the presence of naturally occurring decoherence, and demonstrate resilience against ancilla bit-flips and phase-flips by observing a sixfold suppression of the gate error with increased energy relaxation, and a fourfold suppression with increased dephasing noise. The results demonstrate that bosonic logical qubits can be controlled by error-prone ancilla qubits without inheriting the ancilla's inferior performance. As such, error-corrected ancilla-enabled gates are an important step towards fully fault-tolerant processing of bosonic qubits.},

  abstract  = {Teleportation of a quantum state encompasses the complete transfer of information from one particle to another. The complete specification of the quantum state of a system generally requires an infinite amount of information, even for simple two-level systems (qubits). Moreover, the principles of quantum mechanics dictate that any measurement on a system immediately alters its state, while yielding at most one bit of information. The transfer of a state from one system to another (by performing measurements on the first and operations on the second) might therefore appear impossible. However, it has been shown1 that the entangling properties of quantum mechanics, in combination with classical communication, allow quantum-state teleportation to be performed. Teleportation using pairs of entangled photons has been demonstrated2,3,4,5,6, but such techniques are probabilistic, requiring post-selection of measured photons. Here, we report deterministic quantum-state teleportation between a pair of trapped calcium ions. Following closely the original proposal1, we create a highly entangled pair of ions and perform a complete Bell-state measurement involving one ion from this pair and a third source ion. State reconstruction conditioned on this measurement is then performed on the other half of the entangled pair. The measured fidelity is 75\%, demonstrating unequivocally the quantum nature of the process.},
